[00:03.89] IT's the beat
[00:04.91] He hear it in his sleep sometime
[00:06.12] Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
[00:08.90] Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
[00:11.23] Even when ribs were touchin never swallowed the Ham
[00:14.15] He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
[00:16.10] It might need salt like your mans bland ballad
[00:18.92] A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell yous
[00:21.42] Loose all L juice
[00:22.95] Snooze all hell loose
[00:24.22] Rake it
[00:25.06] Take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
[00:26.70] Break it rollin through ya hood in the cadi buggy
[00:29.39] Butter softy, leather flossy, fatty juggy
[00:31.85] Always threw me off when she told me daddy funk me
[00:35.48] I'm like anywho's
[00:36.99] Seeds walkin all out in street with out any shoes
[00:39.76] I guess it's better than some funky socks
[00:42.04] You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pocks
[00:45.04] Instead she wants to hear the beatbox
[00:46.94] Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
[00:49.74] Sing it
[00:50.68] Bring it back to your laboratory
[00:52.34] While he's in his oratory
[00:53.71] Glorious like a horror story
[00:55.77] The mask is like Jason
[00:57.32] They told the place not to let the basket type case in
[01:00.32] He could be some kind of wacko
[01:02.54] Waiting for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack hoe
[01:05.46] He busted in
[01:06.57] Blessed be the lord
[01:07.69] Who believe any mess then read up on the message board
[01:10.38] If so I got bridges for the low low
[01:12.72] Same bitch a go dry snitchin to the popo
[01:15.52] Yeah orange peal stoges for the hotel
[01:17.88] Feel like I have been gone over a year came home to old gear
[01:20.88] It was the shit when I first scooped it
[01:23.10] At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
[01:26.00] Plead the fifth
[01:26.96] Sip wine stiffly
[01:28.13] Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
[01:30.66] Gift for the grind
[01:31.92] Criminal mind shifty
[01:33.45] Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
[01:36.05] Well edjumacated he heard it when he meditated
[01:38.38] In deep data had her hate the create plata
[01:41.27] Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
[01:43.66] Sage stayed self medicated and sleep later
[01:46.47] Side effects is similar to sugar pill
[01:48.86] Who eva go next on the mic he put a bugger ewwww
[01:51.82] And made his exit on some calm shit
[01:54.11] Begged him on the regular for kegs of more Vomitspit
